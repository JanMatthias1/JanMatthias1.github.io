title: "Exploring the potential of routine serological markers in predicting neurological outcomes in spinal cord injury"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/
excerpt: 'Spinal cord injury (SCI) presents heterogeneously, complicating recovery prediction. We investigated whether routine serological markers measured within seven days post-injury could predict lower extremity motor scores (LEMS) at 52 weeks. Using feature engineering and eight regression models, we compared marker-based predictions against a baseline model of acute LEMS and age. Serological markers did not improve accuracy; the best model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.59, matching baseline. However, stratifying patients by initial LEMS (0 vs. >0) improved MAE by 1.20. Thus, routine serological markers offer limited predictive value, but clinically informed stratification enhances performance.'
