excerpt: 'Dysregulation of autophagy, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components, is linked to aging and various neurodegenerative diseases. The Unc-51-like kinase complex with three additional proteins, FIP200, ATG101, and ATG13, plays a critical role for autophagy initiation. While FIP200â€™s CLAW domain is one of the most conserved regions across species, its exact function remains unclear. We identified that upon CLAW domain deletion and charge inversion, ATG13 and FIP200 co- localization is diminished. Subsequent immunoprecipitation analysis coupled with proteomic analysis revealed significant depletion of the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex in the CLAW deletion and charge inversion conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in vivo, ATG16L1 interacts with a cluster of positively-charged residues on the surface of the FIP200 CLAW domain. This represents a possible mechanism by which ATG16L1 is recruited to the nascent phagophore. ATG16L1 plays an essential role in membrane LC3 lipidation, a vital process for proper autophagosome expansion, cargo recruitment and membrane closure.'
